/*
Practice
-> Make two programs (not using fork)
-> Communicate those two programs through named pipes
-> Read from stdin on each program and write to the named pipe
-> Read from the named pipe on each program and write in stdout
-> Tips
    |
    +-> One of them needs to read first and the other need to write first
    +-> You can see fgets() function to read from stdin and store into a temporary char[]
    +-> You can use a static size of message of 128 chars
